To convert a font for formatting, kindly use the .jar file on this repo.

If you have Java installed, but cannot open .jar files, please use CMD and change the username and path.
`java -jar C:\Users\(UserHere)\(Path of Jar File)\RBXFontMapGenerator.jar`

Credits to M0RGOTH for originally creating the module. I had to fix it.
